	        <p><strong>I was born on 30th June 1990 in Hertfordshire and have lived the majority of my life in the countryside.<br />
            <br />My interest in photography started when I was on holiday in the USA.  
            This was also when I owned my first camera.  
            Due to my disabilities, I struggled to adapt to artistic drawings and so decided to choose photography as an alternative.<br />
            <br />This initial interest led to me selecting photography as a subject for GCSE Art in 2005, 
            which was then followed by undertaking an A Level qualification for the same subject in 2007.   
            With these opportunities, I was able to extend my knowledge and proficiency in digital photography and thus further enhance my experience at university. <br />
           <br />Between 2009 and 2012 I undertook a Bachelorâ€™s of Art Honours Degree in Photography and Digital Media at the University of Hertfordshire.  
           Here, I participated in numerous photography projects, 
           which consisted of portraits and landscape photography, as well as understanding principles of digital cameras and its accompanying equipment.  
           Additionally there were projects involving work in photography studios and darkrooms.  
           The knowledge obtained from this degree course resulted in me earning work experience as a museum photographer in St. Albans, Hertfordshire. 
           Post-degree course (2012-present), I have been undertaking numerous photography projects as well as assisting others with their own photography projects.

           <p><strong>For more information on my work experience and projects, please refer to my CV, 
           which can be viewed <a href="../additional_resources/CV update 2013 .pdf" >here.</a></strong></p>
